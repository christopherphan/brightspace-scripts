These scripts make it easier to work with Desire2Learn Brightspace, especially in conjunction with WeBWorK. They are written for Python 3.

* ``rollsheet_creator.py``: Takes a CSV file produced by the Brightspace grade export feature, and produces a rollsheet.

* ``webwork_classlist_creator.py``: Takes a CSV file produced by the Brightspace grade export feature, and produces a WeBWorK ``.lst`` file.

* ``webwork_grades_to_brightspace.py``: Takes a CSV file produced by the WeBWorK grade export feature, and produces a CSV file suitable for importing into the Brightspace grade book.
